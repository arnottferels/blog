This study draws inspiration from grasshopper biomechanics and contemporary innovations, such as the Yaheetech Sideline Bench, to explore modularity and adaptability in design. Starting with foundational principles, it seamlessly integrates advanced techniques for a harmonious fusion guided by expansion and assembly strategies. The methodology refinement incorporates Machine Learning, specifically Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) by Teuvo Kohonen, diverging from conventional neural networks for a fresh perspective on design optimization.
