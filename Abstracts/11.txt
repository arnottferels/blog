This project investigates shadow dynamics in a large installation at Kumulo Creative Compound, BSD. Scheduled for construction from February to April and exhibition until December 2021, it addresses the hot-humid tropical context. The analysis aims to understand shadow interactions, considering limited natural shade, and assesses the designâ€™s adaptability to pedestrian traffic and various activities.
