In this project, I explore algorithmic modeling using Rhino and Grasshopper, with the goal of integrating my skills to express computational design thinking and methods through the abstraction and implementation of architectural geometry in both parametric and generative approaches. The main focus is on showcasing these concepts through prototyping modeling. Inspired by Bryan Albeiro García Agudelo’s visualization approach, the project emphasizes the significance of clarity and standout features in the visualized model, employing monochrome styles to enhance the architectural work.
