This project revolutionizes urban living in East Jakarta by employing an innovative housing approach using modular containers. Strategically placed near vital amenities, the development introduces two housing types, Type A and Type B, catering to different resident configurations. The inclusion of a plugin system boosts user mobility and facilitates an efficient, organic building process within the Kampong Container. Drawing inspiration from Indonesian culture, communal spaces on each floor cultivate a sense of community, encouraging self-economy and self-energy. Prioritizing sustainability and cultural values, the project addresses Jakartaâ€™s housing requirements while reshaping contemporary living standards.
