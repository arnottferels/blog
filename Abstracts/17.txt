This project introduces a redesigned station to improve how people move around the existing station. The main idea in this design is called ‘Order in Circulation.’ The key focus is on organizing the movement of passengers, couriers, cars, motorbikes, and apartment residents. By solving the main issues at Rawa Buaya Station, the overall urban environment is expected to become more efficient and organized.
