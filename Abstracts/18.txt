This project, named LUNA (Living in Urban with Nature), repurposes an old Paragon warehouse in Jakarta into a sustainable community space. Focused on inclusive green areas, eco-friendly practices, and diverse activities, LUNA transforms the space into a vibrant hub supporting local businesses. With plans for culinary events, sales training, and shared kitchen experiences, LUNA aims to boost the Agricultural Hub brand through effective marketing and social campaigns. The project seeks to diversify revenue streams with co-working spaces and retail sales, ensuring sustained success and community enrichment. In summary, LUNA is an architectural initiative aligned with local needs, transforming an underutilized space into an environmentally conscious haven.
