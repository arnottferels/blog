This study introduces a new bio-façade system in Indonesia, bringing innovation to sustainable architecture. The design focuses on mapping, modeling, and simulating the façade. The algae modules, categorized as Dark, Standard, and Light, adjust to sunlight levels, making the building more comfortable. Simulations show a significant reduction in the Overall Thermal Transfer Value (OTTV) to an impressive 35 W/m², setting a benchmark for energy efficiency. The project generates 131,460 kWh annually, reducing 295,346.8 grams of CO2 daily. It stands out as a model in sustainable architecture, demonstrating the potential of biophilic design in urban environments.
