This project relocates informal street vendors from West Jakarta along Letjen. S. Parman Rd, using experimental architectural exploration to create multi-dimensional spatial definition. Featuring a floating acrylic vista for zone and circulation definition, the design addresses challenges of limited green space and diverse zones near the busy road. Integrating experimental layers, materials, and facades, the Hawker Center creatively tackles the districtâ€™s shortage of public spaces and green areas. The split structure incorporates elements like a steel frame, polycarbonate panels, and tensile structures, enhancing architectural creativity and the urban environment.
