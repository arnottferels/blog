This project signifies a transformative change at Jakartaâ€™s Kebon Melati Reservoir (KMR), establishing connections among communities through a circular design, inclusive culinary spaces, and versatile platforms. The primary objectives include boosting the local economy and addressing Nature Deficit Disorder, creating a harmonious environment for community growth.

Established in 1966, KMR holds a vital role in Jakarta, strategically positioned between slums and commercial areas, near landmarks like Grand Indonesia Mall, Thamrin Residence, and Mall. Serving as a connecting bridge, the reservoir dynamically transforms, reflecting the principles of Jurgen Habermas, the German philosopher.
