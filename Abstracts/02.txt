This study aims to create designs for government housing in Kemayoran, Jakarta, specifically for people with lower incomes. The approach is innovative, focusing on changing how buildings are designed. Despite challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, the project transforms urban areas by combining flexibility and environmental consideration. The design incorporates nature-friendly concepts, including communal green spaces. Tools like the Galapagos Solver are used to shape the exteriors of buildings and adapt interiors based on the weather. The primary focus is on natural cooling and protection from the sun. The research suggests that planning cities this way results in homes that meet current needs and address significant challenges in the future.
