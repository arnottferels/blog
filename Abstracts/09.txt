This project delves into two design options: Pyramid and Wave Rattan pattern generation. The Pyramid approach involves systematically creating intricate two-dimensional patterns, refining them in the third dimension using weaving techniques, thereby enhancing the understanding of multidimensional pattern manipulation. The Wave design introduces a rattan object shaped like a flag for the ceiling, fulfilling the clientâ€™s need for visibility from diverse angles, particularly from the bed. This addition contributes a dynamic and visually appealing element to the overall space.
