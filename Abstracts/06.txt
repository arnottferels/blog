This study integrates bio-data with mathematical structural dynamics to investigate how natureâ€™s imprints manifest on mathematical surfaces. Emphasizing adaptability and modularity, tools like Rhino, Grasshopper, and Milipede are employed to transform natural growth patterns into 3D architectures. As the study unfolds, it incorporates optimization mechanisms, notably the Galapagos plugin and K-means Clustering in machine learning. This fusion of traditional and contemporary techniques provides a comprehensive, data-informed perspective in the field of computational design.
